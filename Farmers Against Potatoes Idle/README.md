A QOL bot for [Farmers Against Potatoes Idle](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1535560/Farmer_Against_Potatoes_Idle/)
I automated some things, including:
- The whack a mole minigame requiring checking of particular positions to see if a valid potato (non-alien) is there to click. This was optimized by doing fuzzier checking of the pixels in a small region.
- Checking if the inventory is full to equip better equipment and recycle the rest. This requires navigation between pages.
