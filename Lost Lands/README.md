An autoclicker for a hidden object finding game, [Lost Lands](https://store.steampowered.com/app/392950/Lost_Lands_A_Hidden_Object_Adventure/)

Fortunately the game doesn't penalize spam clicking, and I got a quest that required a lot of grinding for resources, so I just wrote this script to take care of the menial part of things. It basically clicks in a rectangular area in the screen, doing a complete search of the space for the hidden objects. Note that multiple passes might be required (thus the prompt to activate with space)
